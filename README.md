# Aliexpress-to-eBay-Product-Importer
*EDIT: This was a personal project I made 4 years ago when I was first learning how to develop web applications. I was using the Django framework.* 

This a tool for eBay sellers to import an Aliexpress product onto their eBay store automatically, by simply entering the product's URL. The user pastes an Aliexpress product URL on the first page, then they are taken to a product page where they can see how the product would look on eBay. You can interact with the product page by clicking different variants, and the price and picutre of that variant (if the variant has pictures) pop up dynamically.
